  <h1>ESP8266: Tiny WiFi Chip for Big IoT Ideas</h1>
  <p>The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microchip that lets you add Wi-Fi capabilities to your Internet of Things (IoT) projects.</p>

  <h2>Key Features:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Wi-Fi Connectivity: Connect your creations to the internet for remote control and data sharing.</li>
    <li>Onboard Processing: Built-in processing power allows your device to gather sensor data and make decisions.</li>
    <li>Beginner-Friendly Programming: Easy to program using popular platforms like Arduino IDE.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cybersecurity Applications (for educational purposes only)</h2>
  <p>While not designed specifically for cybersecurity, the ESP8266's features can be used creatively to assist with security measures:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Intrusion Detection System (IDS): An ESP8266 can be programmed to monitor your Wi-Fi network for suspicious activity, such as unknown devices, jamming attempts, or deauthentication attacks. By analyzing network traffic, it can trigger alerts or take basic actions to mitigate risks.</li>
    <li>Honeytrap: Security researchers use "honeypots" to attract attackers. An ESP8266 can be set up as a fake device to lure hackers. If a hacker tries to exploit it, the ESP8266 can collect information about their attack methods, helping identify potential threats.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Important Considerations:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Limited Processing Power: The ESP8266 may not be suitable for complex security analysis due to its processing limitations.</li>
    <li>Security Hardening: Ensure the ESP8266 has the latest firmware, strong passwords, and avoid connecting it to untrusted networks.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The ESP8266 can be a valuable tool for basic security monitoring or as part of a larger security system. However, it should not be your primary defense mechanism.</p>

  <h2>Example: ESP8266 Deauther (for educational purposes only)</h2>

  <p>The ESP8266 is the core component behind the ESP8266 Deauther project (<a href="https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther">https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther</a>), used for Wi-Fi security testing. Remember to use this tool responsibly and legally. Here's how the ESP8266 is used in the deauther:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Wi-Fi Scanning: Scans for nearby networks and identifies connected devices.</li>
    <li>Deauthentication Attacks: Exploits a common Wi-Fi vulnerability by sending deauthentication packets, tricking devices into disconnecting from the network and potentially disrupting connections.</li>
    <li>Denial-of-Service (DoS): Floods the network with fake traffic or deauthentication packets, overloading the Wi-Fi network and temporarily disabling it for all connected devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Hardware Required (for educational purposes only):</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>SSD1306 OLED Display</li>
    <li>3 Tactile Buttons</li>
    <li>Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Software and Programming Instructions:</h2>

  <p>This section would typically include instructions on obtaining and uploading code to the ESP8266. You'll need to replace the bracketed text with specific instructions for your project.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Download and unzip the code </li>
    <li>Upload the code to the Wemos D1 Mini following these instructions </li>
  </ul>
